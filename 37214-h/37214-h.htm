<P CLASS="poem">
<I>Come from your bed my drowsy gentleman!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you, fair lady, rise and braid your hair,<BR>
And let the children wash, if wash they can;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, assist you them, and make them fair<BR>
As is the morning and the morning sky,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every tree and bush and bird in air.</I><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>The sun climbed on the heights three hours ago,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed above the hills and they were glad;<BR>
With bubbled pearl he made the rivers flow<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laced their mists in silver, and he clad<BR>
The meads in fragrant pomp of green and gold,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bade the world forget it had been sad.</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>So lift yourself, good sir! and you, sweet dame,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlash your evening eyes of pious grey;<BR>
Call on the children by each loved name,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set them on the grass and let them play;<BR>
And play with them a while, and sing with them<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the cherry bush a roundelay.</I><BR>

BREAKFAST TIME<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
The sun is always in the sky<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever I get out of bed,<BR>
And I often wonder why<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's never late.&mdash;My sister said<BR>
She did not know who did the trick,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that she did not care a bit,<BR>
And I should eat my porridge quick.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... I think it's mother wakens it.<BR>

IN THE ORCHARD<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
There was a giant by the Orchard Wall<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peeping about on this side and on that,<BR>
And feeling in the trees: he was as tall<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the big apple tree, and twice as fat:<BR>
His beard was long, and bristly-black, and there<BR>
Were leaves and bits of grass stuck in his hair.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He held a great big club in his right hand,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the other felt in every tree<BR>
For something that he wanted.  You could stand<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him and not reach up to his knee<BR>
So mighty big he was&mdash;I feared he would<BR>
Turn round, and trample down to where I stood.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I tried to get away, but, as I slid<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a bush, he saw me, and he bent<BR>
Far down and said, "<I>Where is the Princess hid?</I>"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pointed to a place, and off he went&mdash;<BR>
But while he searched I turned and simply flew<BR>
Round by the lilac bushes back to you.<BR>

DAY AND NIGHT<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
When the bright eyes of the day<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open on the dusk, to see<BR>
Mist and shadow fade away<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sun shine merrily,<BR>
Then I leave my bed and run<BR>
Out to frolic in the sun.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Through the sunny hours I play<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the stream is wandering,<BR>
Plucking daisies by the way;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I laugh and dance and sing,<BR>
While the birds fly here and there<BR>
Singing on the sunny air.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
When the night comes, cold and slow,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sad moon walks the sky,<BR>
When the whispering wind says "<I>Boh,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little boy!</I>" and makes me cry,<BR>
By my mother I am led<BR>
Home again and put to bed.<BR>

THE DEVIL'S BAG<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
I saw the Devil walking down the lane<BR>
Behind our house.&mdash;There was a heavy bag<BR>
Strapped tightly on his shoulders, and the rain<BR>
Sizzled when it hit him.  He picked a rag<BR>
Up from the ground and put it in his sack,<BR>
And grinned and rubbed his hands.<BR>
There was a thing<BR>
Moving inside the bag upon his back&mdash;<BR>
It must have been a soul!  I saw it fling<BR>
And twist about inside, and not a hole<BR>
Or cranny for escape!  Oh, it was sad!<BR>
I cried, and shouted out, "<I>Let out that soul!</I>"<BR>
But he turned round, and, sure, his face went mad,<BR>
And twisted up and down, and he said "<I>Hell!</I>"<BR>
And ran away....  Oh, mammy! I'm not well.<BR>

A VISIT FROM ABROAD<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
A speck went blowing up against the sky<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As little as a leaf: then it drew near<BR>
And broadened.&mdash;"It's a bird," said I,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fetched my bow and arrows.  It was queer!<BR>
It grew up from a speck into a blot,<BR>
And squattered past a cloud; then it flew down<BR>
All crumply, and waggled such a lot<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought the thing would fall.&mdash;It was a brown<BR>
Old carpet where a man was sitting snug<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, when he reached the ground, began to sew<BR>
A big hole in the middle of the rug,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kept on peeping everywhere to know<BR>
Who might be coming&mdash;then he gave a twist<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flew away....  I fired at him but missed.<BR>

THE WOOD OF FLOWERS<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
I went to the Wood of Flowers<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(No one was with me);<BR>
I was there alone for hours.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was happy as could be<BR>
In the Wood of Flowers.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There was grass on the ground,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were buds on the tree,<BR>
And the wind had a sound<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such gaiety,<BR>
That I was as happy<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As happy could be,<BR>
In the Wood of Flowers.<BR>

THE WHITE WINDOW<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
The moon comes every night to peep<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the window where I lie,<BR>
And I pretend to be asleep;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I watch the moon as it goes by,<BR>
And it never makes a sound.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
It stands and stares, and then it goes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the house that's next to me,<BR>
Stealing on its tippy-toes,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To peep at folk asleep maybe;<BR>
And it never makes a sound.<BR>

MIDNIGHT<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
And then I wakened up in such a fright;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I heard a movement in the room<BR>
But did not dare to look; I snuggled right<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down underneath the bedclothes&mdash;then the boom<BR>
Of a tremendous voice said, "<I>Sit up, lad,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let me see your face.</I>"  So up I sat,<BR>
Although I didn't want to.  I was glad<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did though, for it was an angel that<BR>
Had called me, and he said, he'd come to know<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was I the boy who wouldn't say his prayers<BR>
Nor do his sums, and that I'd have to go<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight down to hell because of such affairs.<BR>
... I said I'd be converted and do good<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he would let me off&mdash;he said he would.<BR>

BEHIND THE HILL<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Behind the hill I met a man in green<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who asked me if my mother had gone out?<BR>
I said she had.  He asked me had I seen<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His castle where the people sing and shout<BR>
From dawn to dark, and told me that he had<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crock of gold inside a hollow tree,<BR>
And I could have it.&mdash;I wanted money bad<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To buy a sword with, and I thought that he<BR>
Would keep his solemn word; so, off we went.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said he had a pound hid in the crock,<BR>
And owned the castle too, and paid no rent<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To any one, and that you had to knock<BR>
Five hundred times.  I asked, "<I>Who reckoned up?</I>"<BR>
And he said, "<I>You insulting little pup!</I>"<BR>

Something that was in my mind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday&mdash;<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Something that I did not know<BR>

THE TURN OF THE ROAD<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
I was playing with my hoop along the road<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just where the bushes are, when, suddenly,<BR>
There came a shout.&mdash;I ran away and stowed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself beneath a bush, and watched to see<BR>
What made the noise, and then, around the bend,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a woman running.  She was old<BR>
And wrinkle-faced, and had big teeth.&mdash;The end<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her red shawl caught on a bush and rolled<BR>
Right off her, and her hair fell down.&mdash;Her face<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was awful white, and both her eyes looked sick,<BR>
And she was talking queer.  "<I>O God of Grace!</I>"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said she, "<I>where is the child?</I>" and flew back quick<BR>
The way she came, and screamed, and shook her hands;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... Maybe she was a witch from foreign lands.<BR>

THE CORAL ISLAND<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
His arms were round a chest of oaken wood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was clamped with brass and iron studs, and seemed<BR>
An awful weight.  After a while he stood<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I stole near to him.&mdash;His white eyes gleamed<BR>
As he peeped secretly about; he laid<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oaken chest upon the ground, then drew<BR>
A great knife from his belt, and stuck the blade<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the ground and dug.  The clay soon flew<BR>
In all directions underneath a tree,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the hole was deep he put the box<BR>
Down there, and threw the clay back cunningly,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stamping the ground quite flat; then like a fox<BR>
He crept among the trees....  I went next day<BR>
To dig the treasure up, but I lost my way.<BR>

WHAT THE SNAKE SAW<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
A little girl and a big ugly man<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went down the road.  The girl was crying<BR>
And asking to go home, but when she ran<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hit her on the head and sent her flying,<BR>
And called her a young imp, and said he'd break<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her neck unless she went with him, and then<BR>
He smacked her on the cheek.&mdash;I was a snake<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time crawling through a robber's den,<BR>
And diamonds were sticking to my tongue&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(That's the best dodge), but when I saw the way<BR>
He beat the little girl I up and flung<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stone at him.  My aim was bad that day<BR>
Because I hit the girl ... and she did sing!<BR>
But he jumped round and cursed like anything.<BR>

THE HORSE<BR>

A sparrow hopped about the street,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was not a bit afraid;<BR>
He flew between a horse's feet,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ate his supper undismayed:<BR>
I think myself the horse knew well<BR>
The bird came for the grains that fell.<BR>

For his eye was looking down,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he danced the corn about<BR>
In his nose-bag, till the brown<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grains of corn were tumbled out;<BR>
And I fancy that he said,<BR>
"Eat it up, young Speckle-Head!"<BR>

I was hiding in the crooked apple tree,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scouting for Indians, when a man came;<BR>
I thought it was an Indian, for he<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was running like the wind.&mdash;There was a flame<BR>
Of sunlight on his hand as he drew near,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I saw a knife gripped in his fist.<BR>
He panted like a horse; his eyes were queer,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wide-open, staring frightfully, and, hist!<BR>
His mouth stared open like another eye,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all his hair was matted down with sweat.<BR>
I crouched among the leaves for fear he'd spy<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I was hiding, so he did not get<BR>
His awful eyes on me, but like the wind<BR>
He fled as if he heard something behind.<BR>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
